I’m hoping you’ll find<br/>it a useful project with some adventure in store–it certainly seems like<br/>an adventure for me to be writing this.</p><p>In 2017 the British Museum, London held an exhibition of the work of<br/>Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai.</p><p>![](britishmuseum1.jpg)</p><p>I’m about to make a tenuous link from the art to this project about<br/>computing, bear with me. In about 1830, Hokusai and his daughter Ōi<br/>created a series of prints called [36 views of Mount<br/>Fuji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty-six_Views_of_Mount_Fuji).<br/>They were published in groups over a number of months, and made use of<br/>new materials; available to Japanese artists economically for the first<br/>time (for example, the pigment *Berlin Blue*). For the price of a bowl<br/>of noodles, anyone could buy a print in the series; the most famous of<br/>which is *The Great Wave*.</p><p>We’ve reached a similar happy time in computing. For the price of a PS4<br/>game, anyone can buy a Raspberry Pi computer, take over the family TV as<br/>a monitor and explore the fantastic fun of computing. Also the Pi is<br/>powerful enough to support seriously capable programming tools–Python is<br/>rightly of course incredibly popular, but is only one of many systems<br/>which can be used in this activity; available for the price of a couple<br/>of minutes of your time installing them.</p><p>This series will use the [Racket](http://racket-lang.org) language and<br/>system, which I hope we’ll be able to discover together. If programming<br/>languages are the computing equivalent of a Swiss Army Knife (™<br/>Victorinox AG), Racket is like having a Swiss Army Knife factory.<br/>Experiencing it is well worth your time and effort, even (especially) if<br/>you plan to use other languages mostly.</p><p>The emphasis will be on *physical computing*—using the Pi to sense and<br/>control the external world, which is the funnest fun available.</p><p>Together, the Pi, Racket and some simple hardware which you can build<br/>are a great combination of indoor adventure kit we can use on this<br/>little escapade. I’ve stolen Hokusai-sensei’s title and hopefully<br/>spirit–hence *32 views of computing—with Racket and Raspberry Pi*. I<br/>like the multiple ‘views’ approach, because it provides myself and the<br/>reader with small, hopefully approachable chunks to digest. And *32*<br/>because, computers like powers of two.</p><p>I like the multiple ‘views’ approach, because it provides us all with<br/>small, hopefully approachable chunks to digest. And *32* because,<br/>computers like [powers of<br/>two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_two).</p><p>The plan is to publish in segments, each available for the price of a<br/>bowl of noodles, though sadly I won’t be offering a ring binder as a<br/>special offer with the first one. Or noodles.</p><p>### More to read</p><p>[Hokusai: beyond the Great Wave–The British Museum<br/>Blog](https://blog.britishmuseum.org/new-exhibition-announced-hokusai-beyond-the-great-wave/)</p><p>[Raspberry Pi - Teach, Learn, and Make with Raspberry<br/>Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org)</p><p>You can [sign up](https://tinyletter.com/32views) to be notified when<br/>the first instalment is available.</p></div></body>\n</html>"
