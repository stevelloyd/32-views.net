I'm hoping you'll find\nit a useful project with some adventure in store–it certainly seems like\nan adventure for me to be writing this.\n\nIn 2017 the British Museum, London held an exhibition of the work of\nJapanese artist Katsushika Hokusai.\n\n\n![](britishmuseum1.jpg)\n\n\nI’m about to make a tenuous link from the art to this project about\ncomputing, bear with me. In about 1830, Hokusai and his daughter Ōi\ncreated a series of prints called [36 views of Mount\nFuji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty-six_Views_of_Mount_Fuji).\nThey were published in groups over a number of months, and made use of\nnew materials; available to Japanese artists economically for the first\ntime (for example, the pigment *Berlin Blue*). For the price of a bowl\nof noodles, anyone could buy a print in the series; the most famous of\nwhich is *The Great Wave*.\n\n\nWe've reached a similar happy time in computing. For the price of a PS4\ngame, anyone can buy a Raspberry Pi computer, take over the family TV as\na monitor and explore the fantastic fun of computing. Also the Pi is\npowerful enough to support seriously capable programming tools–Python is\nrightly of course incredibly popular, but is only one of many systems\nwhich can be used in this activity; available for the price of a couple\nof minutes of your time installing them.\n\n\nThis series will use the [Racket](http://racket-lang.org) language and\nsystem, which I hope we'll be able to discover together. If programming\nlanguages are the computing equivalent of a Swiss Army Knife (™\nVictorinox AG), Racket is like having a Swiss Army Knife factory.\nExperiencing it is well worth your time and effort, even (especially) if\nyou plan to use other languages mostly.\n\n\nThe emphasis will be on *physical computing*—using the Pi to sense and\ncontrol the external world, which is the funnest fun available.\n\n\nTogether, the Pi, Racket and some simple hardware which you can build\nare a great combination of indoor adventure kit we can use on this\nlittle escapade. I've stolen Hokusai-sensei's title and hopefully\nspirit–hence *32 views of computing—with Racket and Raspberry Pi*. I\nlike the multiple 'views' approach, because it provides myself and the\nreader with small, hopefully approachable chunks to digest. And *32*\nbecause, computers like powers of two.\n\nI like the multiple 'views' approach, because it provides us all with\nsmall, hopefully approachable chunks to digest. And *32* because,\ncomputers like [powers of\ntwo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_two).\n\nThe plan is to publish in segments, each available for the price of a\nbowl of noodles, though sadly I won’t be offering a ring binder as a\nspecial offer with the first one. Or noodles.\n\n\n### More to read\n\n[Hokusai: beyond the Great Wave – The British Museum\nBlog](https://blog.britishmuseum.org/new-exhibition-announced-hokusai-beyond-the-great-wave/)\n\n[Raspberry Pi - Teach, Learn, and Make with Raspberry\nPi](https://www.raspberrypi.org)\n\n\nYou can [sign up](https://tinyletter.com/32views) to be notified when\nthe first instalment is available.\n\n    </div>\n    </body>\n</html>"
