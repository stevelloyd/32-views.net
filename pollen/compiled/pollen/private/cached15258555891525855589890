I'm hoping you'll find" "\n" "it a useful project with some adventure in store–it certainly seems like" "\n" "an adventure for me to be writing this."

"\n" "\n" "\n" "![](britishmuseum1.jpg)" "\n" "\n" "\n" "I’m about to make a tenuous link from the art to this project about" "\n" "computing, bear with me. In about 1830, Hokusai and his daughter Ōi" "\n" "created a series of prints called [36 views of Mount" "\n" "Fuji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty-six_Views_of_Mount_Fuji)." "\n" "They were published in groups over a number of months, and made use of" "\n" "new materials; available to Japanese artists economically for the first" "\n" "time (for example, the pigment *Berlin Blue*). For the price of a bowl" "\n" "of noodles, anyone could buy a print in the series; the most famous of" "\n" "which is *The Great Wave*." "\n" "\n" "\n" "We've reached a similar happy time in computing. For the price of a PS4" "\n" "game, anyone can buy a Raspberry Pi computer, take over the family TV as" "\n" "a monitor and explore the fantastic fun of computing. Also the Pi is" "\n" "powerful enough to support seriously capable programming tools–Python is" "\n" "rightly of course incredibly popular, but is only one of many systems" "\n" "which can be used in this activity; available for the price of a couple" "\n" "of minutes of your time installing them." "\n" "\n" "\n" "This series will use the [Racket](http://racket-lang.org) language and" "\n" "system, which I hope we'll be able to discover together. If programming" "\n" "languages are the computing equivalent of a Swiss Army Knife (™" "\n" "Victorinox AG), Racket is like having a Swiss Army Knife factory." "\n" "Experiencing it is well worth your time and effort, even (especially) if" "\n" "you plan to use other languages mostly." "\n" "\n" "\n" "The emphasis will be on *physical computing*—using the Pi to sense and" "\n" "control the external world, which is the funnest fun available." "\n" "\n" "\n" "Together, the Pi, Racket and some simple hardware which you can build" "\n" "are a great combination of indoor adventure kit we can use on this" "\n" "little escapade. I've stolen Hokusai-sensei's title and hopefully" "\n" "spirit–hence *32 views of computing—with Racket and Raspberry Pi*. I" "\n" "like the multiple 'views' approach, because it provides myself and the" "\n" "reader with small, hopefully approachable chunks to digest. And *32*" "\n" "because, computers like powers of two." "\n" "\n" "I like the multiple 'views' approach, because it provides us all with" "\n" "small, hopefully approachable chunks to digest.
